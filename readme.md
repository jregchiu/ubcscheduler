# Course Scheduler

Course Scheduler is a tool built using [Google Optimization Tools (OR-Tools)](https://developers.google.com/optimization/) to solve university course scheduling problems.

### Requirements

Python 3.6.5 and OR-Tools 6.7.x or higher are required. The use of a virtual environment is recommended, preferrably through [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). All other dependencies are managed through `pip` after cloning the repo via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
