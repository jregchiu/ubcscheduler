# Course Scheduler

This is a scheduling tool built using [Google Optimization Tools (OR-Tools)](https://developers.google.com/optimization/) to solve university course scheduling problems.

### Requirements

Python 3.6.5 and OR-Tools 6.7.x or higher are required. It's recommended to use a virtual environment, most likely through [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). All other dependencies are managed through `pip` after cloning the repo via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
